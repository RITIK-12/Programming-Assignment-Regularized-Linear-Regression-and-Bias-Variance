Programming Assignment 5 in Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera

The course info can be found here https://class.coursera.org/ml-004/class/index  
The details of this assignment is described in ex5.pdf

The codes are written by Octave.  
For further info of Octave please see http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/

In this assignment set, a small neural network with logistic regression for recognising hand-written digits will be created.  
This set include the following functions:  

ex5.m - Octave script that will help step you through the exercise  
ex5data1.mat - Dataset  
featureNormalize.m - Feature normalization function  
fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc)  
plotFit.m - Plot a polynomial fit
trainLinearReg.m - Trains linear regression using your cost function  
linearRegCostFunction.m - Regularized linear regression cost function  
learningCurve.m - Generates a learning curve  
polyFeatures.m - Maps data into polynomial feature space  
validationCurve.m - Generates a cross validation curve
